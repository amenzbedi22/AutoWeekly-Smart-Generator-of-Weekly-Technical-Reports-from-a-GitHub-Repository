## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

### 2. Install Required Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

```bash
pip install requests python-dateutil
```

### 3. Configure Your GitHub Token

Create a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the following scopes:
- `repo` (to access repo data)
- `read:org` (to access collaborators)
- `project` (to access Project V2)

Then, set your token in the script or via an environment variable:

```bash
# Option 1: Add directly to the script (not recommended for production)
GITHUB_TOKEN = 'ghp_YourTokenHere'

# Option 2: Export as environment variable (recommended)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_YourTokenHere
```

## üßÆ KPI Score Calculation

Each contributor's **KPI Score** is calculated with the following weighted formula:

```text
KPI = (2 √ó add) + (2.5 √ó fix) + (2 √ó bugs_closed) + (3 √ó tasks_completed)
```

| Contribution Type       | Weight |
|-------------------------|--------|
| `add` commits           | 2.0    |
| `fix` commits           | 2.5    |
| Closed `bug` issues     | 2.0    |
| Completed project tasks | 3.0    |
